abstract="This paper proposes a framework used for real-world software development in the academic environment of Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU). The framework thus far has been used to establish the functional baseline for the Predictive Wastewater Management System (PWMS), a participatory sensing system for monitoring and predicting problems occurring in a municipality's wastewater system for the Eastech Corporation. As software development becomes globally distributed, students need immersion in a realistic software development lifecycle (SDLC) and experience with a framework targeted toward this emerging paradigm.",
